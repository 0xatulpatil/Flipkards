## Application Info

The app is currently hosted at

vercel.com
```

Due to the short time of the hack, we were not able to make it completely responsive, the user section works great on mobile while the Retailer's section looks good on laptop screens.
There are other rough edges.

If the app does not work as intended, please check console messages.If the app freezes vist the base URL again and start the process again.
